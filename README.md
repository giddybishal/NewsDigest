An app that proviedes you with lates news from BBC(for now), with the ability to provide summary using LLM.
Want to expand it to different sources, but dont't know how. Atleast for now.
#* Well stumbled upon a huge problem, it seems the tags for the bbc news sections change over time causing the website to not work in different days. Need to find a way to solve this.
